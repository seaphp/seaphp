# Call for Speakers

Our meetups are on the second Tuesday of the month. We try to have 2 talks,
each about 30 minutes with a short break in between.

**Who speaks at Seattle PHP?** People who are just like you! Every member of
Seattle PHP is encouraged to submit to speak. We also welcome guest speakers.
If you have a good talk idea, please share it with us.


## How to speak

- Read the guidelines below.
- Submit a proposal via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seaphp/seaphp/issues/new) or email
  admins@seaphp.com. Please follow the [template](#template-talk-proposal).
- If the proposal sounds like something that will work for our members, we'll
  schedule it.

**Why GitHub issues?** It makes it easy for us to schedule things. If you'd rather
email &mdash; no biggie! Just send your proposal via email (admins@seaphp.com).


## What makes a good talk?

Seattle PHP has over 1,500 members, but obviously not every one shows up for
each meetup. Our membership has a wide range of experienced from a novice
hobbyist to senior engineers.  Due to the breadth of our audience, we try to
have 2 talks &mdash; one for the less experienced, and for the more advanced.
A good talk will be:

* Organized
* Practiced
* Informative
* Provide value to PHP Developers


## What's in a proposal?

In your proposal, tell us about your talk and a little about you. If you have
any additional materials, like a slide deck, site, or repository, please link to
them. [Here's a template](#template-talk-proposal).

Need some ideas? We've created a list of [talk topics](talk-ideas.md) for you.

## Talk Proposal Template

```
# Title of talk

A short description of the talk. The goal should be to explain to people WHY
this topic is interesting and HOW it will help them be better developers or
build better applications. 1-2 paragraphs is fine.
